                Legend of Liczyrzepa - the Spirit of the Mountains
              </h3>
              <p class="section-description legends-description">
                According to the beliefs of the old inhabitants settled at the
                foot of the Karkonosze Mountains, when wandering one had to
                watch out for the Spirit of the Mountains - the fearless
                Karkonosze. Legend has it that one day he fell in love with the
                extraordinarily beautiful Dobrognieva and kidnapped her from the
                castle of the Duke of Swidnica. Attempts to rescue the princess
                were of no use, as no one could match the strength and power of
                the Spirit. He, wanting to provide sufficient comforts for his
                chosen one, gathered turnips from a nearby field to turn them
                into courtiers, ready to fulfill Dobrognieva's every whim.
                Meanwhile, the clever princess plotted a ruse to escape from the
                castle with the help of her beloved Mieszko. Wanting to distract
                Karkonosze, she ordered him to count all the turnips. At that
                time, she and Mieszko slipped away to Swidnica to marry him
                there. Since this incident, the wandering Karkonosz is jokingly
                called Liczyrzepa.

                The Chronicles of Narnia
              </h3>
              <p class="section-description legends-description">
                The Karkonosze Mountains delight with the views spreading from
                the peaks. Numerous hiking trails allow you to reach picturesque
                waterfalls and streams filled with magic. Few people know that
                it was the Karkonosze Mountains, or more precisely the highest
                waterfall in the Polish Sudetes - the Kamienczyk Waterfall -
                that served as the setting for scenes from the film "The
                Chronicles of Narnia." Vertically rising massive rock walls, the
                sound of falling water and lush vegetation make us feel like we
                are in a fairy tale kingdom here. Its name derives from another
                Karkonosze legend. It says that it was created from the tears of
                seven mermaids, mourning their sister Labudka. She was in love
                with Kamienczyk Bronish, who, in search of precious ores for his
                gravely ill mother, fell off a cliff. When the distraught
                Rusalka found the body of her beloved, she slipped and fell near
                Bronish. The sisters mourned for a long time for Labudka, and
                from their tears one of the most beautiful places in the Giant
                Mountains was created.

              <p class="section-description legends-description">
                Few people know that the richness of Karkonosze's mountainous
                landscape, low temperatures, strong hurricane winds and violent
                weather changes have caused it to be often referred to as the
                Polish Alps. There are more than 150 picturesque rock
                formations, rock debris, glacial circuses, mountain lakes and
                countless streams and springs. The Polish Alps, while stunning
                in their beauty, can be demanding. The alpine landscape can
                certainly be found in the Śnieżne Kotły Nature Reserve, which is
                an excellent vantage point. It's also worth taking the "guide's
                revenge," that is, the trail over the Reglami leading to the
                highest peak in the Sudetenland - Sněžka. Before the expedition,
                it is worth taking care of appropriate footwear suited to the
                Karkonosze trails. Shoes that prevent slipping on rocks and
                cushion the foot on uneven ground are the basis of comfort and
                safety. When looking for the right model for your expedition in
                the Giant Mountains, you should pay attention to the Chameleon 7
                line by Merrell, created for mountain hiking enthusiasts, for
                whom foot protection is as important as comfort.

              The building on Sniezka is one of the symbols and most original
              architectural designs in Poland. Where did such a crazy idea come
              from? In the 1950s and 1960s, Lipinski was known for his designs
              of futuristic buildings with characteristic curves and arches. The
              Sniezka Observatory, because of its uninterrupted sequence of
              measurements since 1880, is an ideal place to analyze climate
              change. The data is unique because the summit of Snow Mountain is
              devoid of local influences related to human activity.
